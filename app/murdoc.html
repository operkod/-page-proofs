        <p>The self-taught bassist, with an eternal desire to be the first everywhere, sometimes runs the backing vocals
          in the band. Murdoch likes to hand out interviews, often without really thinking about what, how and to whom he says.
          A former drug addict, a shoplifter, a bully,
          a heavy smoker, scaring children, stealing in shops, mocks 2D.</p>
        <p>
          One of his merits is that it was he who brought Gorillaz together, which he
          is still proud of and never tires of repeating that Gorillaz is his and only his band. It was his fault that STU-Pot became a victim, getting a couple of hard blows to the head.
